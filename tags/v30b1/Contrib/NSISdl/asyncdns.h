** Usage:
**   1. Create JNL_AsyncDNS object, optionally with the number of cache entries.
**   2. call resolve() to resolve a hostname into an address. The return value of 
**      resolve is 0 on success (host successfully resolved), 1 on wait (meaning
**      try calling resolve() with the same hostname in a few hundred milliseconds 
**      or so), or -1 on error (i.e. the host can't resolve).
**   4. enjoy.
